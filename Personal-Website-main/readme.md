One prompt i told chat is to "make my navigation pretty". I already had the nav bar set up, but it was basic so I wanted to give it some style I mainly used the AI 

at first, i had a whole section of all my images on my about.html. this looked too cluttered so I prompted chat with: 

"instead of splitting it up in sections, can i have a horizontal gallery of my images where you can click a button to do the slide show of the images? for example, you would be able to see like 3 pictures at a time, then click the button and it will shift to show the next image"
